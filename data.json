        "Question": "A common assumption among art historians is that the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century displaced the\npainted portrait in the public consciousness. The diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature, which coincided with the\nrise of photography, seems to support this claim. However, photography\u2019s impact on the portrait miniature may be\noverstated. Although records from art exhibitions in the Netherlands from 1820 to 1892 show a decrease in the number of\nboth full-sized and miniature portraits submitted, this trend was established before the invention of photography.\nBased on the text, what can be concluded about the diminishing popularity of the portrait miniature in the nineteenth\ncentury?",
        "Options": {
            "A": "Factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature\u2019s decline.",

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The text says that the impact of photography on the portrait miniature might be \"overstated,\" as\nsome records show a decrease in the number of portrait miniatures before the invention of photography. From this, we can\nconclude that factors other than the rise of photography may be more directly responsible for the portrait miniature\u2019s decline.\nChoice B is incorrect. The text never discusses the \"artistic merit\" of either art form. Choice C is incorrect. The text never\nsuggests that the portrait miniature was popular for longer than historians thought\u2014if anything, it suggests that the portrait\nminiature started losing its popularity earlier than historians thought.

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, conceptual\nartists Gins and Arakawa have designed an apartment building that is disorienting because of several unconventional\nelements, such as uneven kitchen counters and \u201ca door to nowhere.\u201d The text goes on to suggest that there may be benefits\nto this kind of design because filmmaker Yamaoka lived in the apartment building for four years and reported health\nbenefits. Thus, although the design is impractical, it may improve the well-being of the apartment building\u2019s residents.\u00a0\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Yamaoka lived in the apartment for four years, it doesn\u2019t address how\nlong someone can beneficially live in a home surrounded by fanciful features or whether doing so can be sustained.\u00a0Choice\nB is incorrect. Although the text mentions the potential benefits of living in a home with disorienting design features, it\ndoesn\u2019t suggest that this is the most effective method to create a physically stimulating environment.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect\nbecause the text refers to Yamaoka to support the claim that Gins and Arakawa\u2019s apartment building design may be\nbeneficial, but the text doesn\u2019t indicate that Yamaoka supports the designs of other conceptual artists."

The text states that Pando is a colony of about 47,000 quaking aspen trees that represents one of the\nlargest organisms on Earth. According to the text, ecologists are worried that Pando\u2019s growth is declining, partly because\nanimals are feeding on the trees. In other words, the ecologists are worried that Pando isn\u2019t growing at the same rate it used\nto.\nChoice B is incorrect. Rather than indicating that Pando isn\u2019t producing young trees anymore, the text reveals that Pando is\nindeed producing young trees, stating that those trees can be protected from grazing deer by strong fences. Choice C is\nincorrect because the text states that fences can be used to prevent deer from eating Pando\u2019s young trees, not that Pando\nitself can\u2019t grow in new areas because it\u2019s blocked by fences.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text offers no evidence that\nPando\u2019s root system is incapable of supporting new trees or is otherwise a cause of worry for ecologists."

In the text, Heidi screams upon first seeing the picture of the\ngreen pasture. In another context, such a reaction might suggest fear, but here the reaction is followed by descriptions of an\nimage that\u2019s peaceful rather than scary. The text goes on to describe Heidi\u2019s eyes as \u201cglowing\u201d and states that she \u201cdevoured\nthe scene,\u201d suggesting that the image delights and fascinates her so much that she wants to examine every detail.

Before Heidi sees that image, the text describes her as \u201clooking with wondering eyes at the splendid\npictures\u201d in the book, suggesting that Heidi is intrigued, not that she\u2019s unhappy. Choice C is incorrect. Although Heidi\nscreams upon first seeing the image, the text\u2019s description of the image and Heidi\u2019s other reactions to it suggest that she is\nscreaming with delight, not fear.

        "Question": "In superfluorescence, electrical charges known as dipoles emit light in synchronized bursts so intense that they are visible to\nthe eye. Until recently, this phenomenon has only been observed at extremely cold temperatures because dipoles cannot\nsynchronize at higher temperatures. But in a study, Melike Biliroglu and colleagues observed superfluorescence at room\ntemperature in thin films made of perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials; the researchers propose that the\nformation of shock-absorbing quasiparticles called polarons in the material protects dipoles from thermal interference.\nBased on the text, how are polarons believed to be involved in the superfluorescence observed in Biliroglu and colleagues\u2019\nstudy?",
        "Options": {

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes Biliroglu and colleagues\u2019 claim about how the polarons\nfunction in relation to superfluorescence. The text indicates that \u201cuntil recently,\u201d superfluorescence (intense, synchronized\nbursts of light emitted by dipoles) has solely been observed at very cold temperatures. However, it also states that, recently,\nBiliroglu and colleagues report observing the phenomenon at room temperature. They achieved this using \u201cthin films made\nof perovskite and other similarly crystalline materials,\u201d which the researchers claim allows for the formation of polarons.\nThey also suggest that these polarons might absorb the thermal shocks that typically disrupt dipole synchronization at\nwarmer temperatures. Thus, based on the text, Biliroglu and colleagues believe that polarons help dipoles synchronize at\ntemperatures well above those at which superfluorescence had previously been observed.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the prospect of a superfluorescent burst moving between crystalline\nmaterials or any other mediums. Choice C is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might\nenable superfluorescence at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. Rather than\nsuggesting that polarons speed up superfluorescent bursts, the text suggests that no superfluorescence can occur at room\ntemperature in the absence of polarons. Thus, the text indicates that polarons make superfluorescent bursts more likely to\noccur at higher temperatures than those at which it had previously been observed, not that polarons accelerate the bursts.\nChoice D is incorrect because the text\u2019s discussion of polarons is about how they might enable superfluorescence at higher\ntemperatures than those at which it had previously been observed. In the absence of polarons, the text suggests there would\nbe no superfluorescence at room temperature.

In other words, the\ntext suggests that scholars who favor the later composition date need to explain why the poem\u2019s fit with historical context\nshould take precedence over the linguistic evidence, but they have not yet done so. Thus, the main idea of the text is that\nwhile there is some plausibility to the later composition date, advocates for the later date have not compellingly addressed\nevidence suggestive of an earlier date.\u00a0\nChoice A is incorrect because the text says that scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh\ncenturies have failed to account for the linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier, not that the\nevidence those scholars cite in favor of their view is unreliable or that anyone has cast doubt on that evidence. In other\nwords, the text does not suggest that there are problems with the evidence cited by advocates of the later composition date,\nonly that there is other evidence of an earlier composition date that those advocates need to consider.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect\nbecause nothing in the text suggests that those scholars who date the poem to the late ninth through early eleventh\ncenturies are giving priority to a controversial view of the social conditions at that time.

Instead, the text suggests that scholars who date the poem\non the basis of its fit with the historical context of England in the late ninth through early eleventh centuries have failed to\naccount for linguistic evidence that the poem may have been composed earlier.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the text says\nnothing about how well the poem fits the historical context of England in the seventh and eighth centuries, let alone that it\nfits that historical context as well as it fits the historical context of the late ninth through early eleventh centuries.

Although the text mentions that humans have long intervened in dogs\u2019 reproduction by intentionally\ncrossbreeding certain dogs, it doesn\u2019t argue that such intervention is essential to the existence of dog breeds.\u00a0Choice C is\nincorrect because the text doesn\u2019t discuss the popularity of any dog breeds; breeds are mentioned as having certain traits,\nbut the text says nothing about the popularity of these breeds or traits. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text briefly\nmentions that Morrill and colleagues conducted a study about dog traits using both surveys and DNA sequencing, this is not\nthe main focus of the text. The text concerns the study\u2019s results about the heritability of dog traits, not the particular\nmethodology used by Morrill and colleagues."

        },
        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it states why Wang and his team\u2019s discovery of the Terropterus xiushanensis fossil was\nsignificant. The text explains that up until Wang and his team\u2019s discovery, the only fossil evidence of mixopterids came from\nthe paleocontinent of Laurussia. Wang and his team, however, identified fossil remains of a mixopterid species from the\npaleocontinent Gondwana. Therefore, the team\u2019s discovery was significant because the fossil remains of a mixopterid\nspecies were outside of the paleocontinent Laurussia.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text states that Wang and his team identified fossilized remains of a mixopterid species\nthat lived more than 400 million years ago, it doesn\u2019t indicate that mixopterid fossils previously found by scientists dated to a\nmore recent period than that. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that mixopterids are related to modern\narachnids and horseshoe crabs, it doesn\u2019t suggest that the fossil discovered by Wang and his team confirmed that this\nrelationship is closer than scientists had previously thought.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because the team\u2019s fossil established the\npresence of mixopterids on Gondwana, not on Laurussia. Moreover, the text only discusses the fossil in relation to the\ngeographical distribution of mixopterids, not in relation to their evolution."

The text says that corals produce bright colors to block sunlight and encourage algae to\nrecolonize after \u201can environmental stressor.\u201d From this, we can infer that corals that produce bright colors have probably\nbeen subjected to an environmental stressor.\nChoice B is incorrect. The text says that corals produce bright colors to block intense sunlight, which protects the light-\nsensitive algae that keep the coral healthy. In other words, bright colors make the coral\u2019s health less vulnerable to intense\nsunlight. Choice C is incorrect.

The text begins by mentioning\nNASA\u2019s Aspera mission, which will investigate the low-density gas that makes up the circumgalactic medium (CGM).\nAccording to the text, this mission will focus on a portion of the CGM\u2019s gas that exists in a \u201cwarm-hot\u201d phase; this \u201cwarm-hot\u201d\ngas has not been previously observed, but it is thought to make up most of the mass of galaxies and play a part in star\nformation. Finally, the text mentions a telescope capable of examining this previously unobservable \u201cwarm-hot\u201d gas: the\nAspera mission will use this telescope in the hope of answering questions about galaxy formation and change. Therefore,\nthe main idea of the text is that the Aspera mission is likely to produce the first direct observations of CGM gas in the \u201cwarm-\nhot\u201d phase, which likely has an important role in the evolution of galaxies.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although this choice mentions the Aspera mission, names its leader, and generally states the mission\u2019s\npurpose, it does not reference the \u201cwarm-hot\u201d gas or fully convey the reason why the Aspera mission is significant. Choice B\nis incorrect. Although this choice mentions the \u201cwarm-hot\u201d gas that makes up a portion of the CGM, it does not reference the\nAspera mission or describe its importance. The text also does not mention that galaxies surrounded by the CGM have been\nstudied. Choice C is incorrect.

Farmer has shown that expanding the array of primary sources to encompass\nmore types of print material\u2014including political cartoons, advertisements, and artwork\u2014leads to a much better\nunderstanding of the movement and the crucial and diverse roles that Black women played in shaping it.\u00a0\nWhich choice best describes the main idea of the text?",

Although the text indicates that one of Hunt\u2019s sculptures is made of steel and another of bronze, there\nis no mention of why he chose these materials. Choice C is incorrect because the text says nothing about how Hunt chose\nthe subjects for his sculptures. Furthermore, of the two examples provided in the text, only Ida B.

Although the one exceptional moon orbits in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin, its orbit is highly eccentric\ncompared to the rest, which may suggest that it has a different origin than the other 19 moons.\nBased on the text, which choice best describes the moon with the eccentric orbit?",

            "D": "It has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn."
        },
        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the moon with the eccentric orbit. The text indicates that\nthree of the 20 newly discovered moons have prograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the same direction as the\nplanet\u2019s spin, while the other 17 moons have retrograde orbits, meaning that they orbit Saturn in the opposite direction of the\nplanet\u2019s spin. The text then states that 19 of the 20 moons appear to be the remains of earlier bodies that orbited Saturn but\nwere broken apart in collisions. The one exception is a moon that orbits Saturn in the same direction as the planet\u2019s spin,\nmeaning that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is prograde. The text goes on to state that the exceptional moon\u2019s orbit is so\neccentric that the moon may have formed through a different process than the other 19 moons. The moon with the eccentric\norbit, therefore, has a prograde orbit and may not be a remnant of an earlier body that orbited Saturn.\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in the text supports the idea that the moon with the eccentric orbit likely has the same\norigin as the moons with retrograde orbits. Although it\u2019s true that the moon has a prograde orbit (and thus doesn\u2019t have a\nretrograde orbit), the only information the text provides about the moon\u2019s origin is that it may be different than the origin of\nthe other 19 moons. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that the moon in question orbits Saturn in the same\ndirection as the planet\u2019s spin, meaning that the moon\u2019s orbit is prograde, not that its orbit is neither prograde nor retrograde.\nChoice C is incorrect because the text merely notes that the moon in question has a prograde orbit without giving any\nindication of what likely caused that orbit."

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a description of how the human mind is like a flower that is directly\nsupported by the text. The text compares the needs of a \u201cfragile and lovely flower\u201d to those of the speaker\u2019s \u201ctender mind\u201d:\nboth need to be fed if they\u2019re going to survive. Without such feeding, they\u2019ll \u201cbeginneth straightway to languish,\u201d or weaken.\nThus, the text suggests that the human mind is like a flower in that they both need proper nourishment in order to thrive.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t address the passage of time or describe either the human mind or a flower as\nbecoming increasingly vigorous.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that human minds or flowers draw\nstrength from changes in weather. The references to rain in the text pertain to a flower\u2019s need for water rather than the\ngeneral effects of changing weather.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because\u00a0the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the human mind or a flower\nwill persist regardless of challenging circumstances. In fact, the text indicates that they\u2019ll both languish right away if not\ngiven what they need."

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states the main purpose of the text. In the first part of the text, the\nspeaker addresses Paul Laurence Dunbar\u2019s ability to understand people (he has \u201cread the hearts and souls of men\u201d and\nwritten of their \u201cjoy and mirth\u201d).

Thus, the text mainly praises\nDunbar for being especially perceptive about people and nature.\u00a0\nChoice B is incorrect because the speaker describes Dunbar as having read the \u201chearts and souls of men\u201d and the \u201clanguage\nof flowers\u201d to convey Dunbar\u2019s ability to comprehend people and nature, not to suggest that Dunbar has literally read any of\nthese things or has read a great deal about them.

Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on Dunbar\u2019s understanding of people and\nnature as expressed in his writing. Nothing in the text suggests that the speaker is recalling a particular afternoon actually\nspent in nature with Dunbar; even if there had been a shared experience, the text isn\u2019t focused on reminiscing."

The text describes a study assessing how children think of rewards and fairness and its results.\nIt concludes that the children in the study may have thought that a teacher who counted out loud when giving rewards cared\nmore about fairness than a teacher who did not count out loud.\nChoice A is incorrect. The children in the study are described as being \u201cfour to six,\u201d and the text doesn\u2019t mention any\ndifferences among the different ages. Choice B is incorrect. The experiment wasn\u2019t about teaching math\u2014rather, it was\nabout how counting out loud affected the children\u2019s perception of fairness. Choice C is incorrect.

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a statement about how the Lord Chancellor responds to the crowd that is\nsupported by the text. The text indicates that the people in the crowd are roaring and shouting \u201cBread!\u201d or \u201cTaxes!\u201d and\npresents them as not knowing what they really want. The Lord Chancellor\u2019s response is to ask what their shouting means but\nalso to observe that they\u2019re shouting with \u201cunanimity,\u201d or total agreement. Clearly, this isn\u2019t the case, which supports the\nstatement that the Lord Chancellor describes the crowd as being united even though it\u2019s not.\u00a0\nChoice A is incorrect because it isn\u2019t supported by the text. Although the text indicates that the Lord Chancellor asks about\nthe meaning of the crowd\u2019s shouting, it doesn\u2019t suggest that he knows what the crowd really wants. Choice B is incorrect\nbecause the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the Lord Chancellor wants to speak to the crowd. Furthermore, the text doesn\u2019t\nindicate that the crowd wants to hear from the Sub-Warden. Although the crowd roars when asked \u201cWho roar for the Sub-\nWarden?\u201d it\u2019s unclear what the roaring means. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn\u2019t suggest that the Lord\nChancellor knows of or sympathizes with the crowd\u2019s demands. In addition, the text doesn\u2019t indicate that the crowd\u2019s\nshouting annoys the Lord Chancellor, just that it causes him to keep repeating \u201cWhat can it all mean?\u201d"

The text describes how Alspaugh\u2019s scrapbook is both a record of her life and a historical record of\nnineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking.\nChoice A is incorrect. The text says that it was common for American women to keep scrapbooks of fabric pieces in the\nnineteenth century, and it says that Alspaugh was one of these women. However, it never says that other women were\ninspired by Alspaugh. Choice B is incorrect. This is too general and too strong.

        "Question": "Some animal-behavior studies involve observing wild animals in their natural habitat, and some involve capturing wild\nanimals and observing them in a laboratory. Each approach has advantages over the other. In wild studies, researchers can\nmore easily presume that the animals are behaving normally, and in lab studies, researchers can more easily control factors\nthat might affect the results. But if, for example, the results from a wild study and a lab study of Western scrub-jays\n(Aphelocoma californica) contradict each other, one or both of the studies must have failed to account for some factor that\nwas relevant to the birds\u2019 behavior.\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?",

The text begins by explaining that\nwild animals can be studied in their natural habitat or in a laboratory setting, with each setting offering unique advantages to\nresearchers. The text then highlights an instance in which Western scrub-jays were studied in both settings but with\nconflicting results, indicating that one or both studies may have failed to account for the disadvantages of its research\nsetting. Thus, the main idea of the text is that while wild animals can be effectively studied in natural or lab settings, there\nare drawbacks to each that need to be considered to ensure accurate results.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text does not position one study setting (natural or lab) as superior to the other; rather, the\ntext states that each one has advantages over the other.\u00a0Choice B is incorrect. The text provides a hypothetical example of\ntwo studies in different environments with conflicting results, but this single example cannot be extrapolated to a general\nclaim about the likelihood that results of studies in different environments will conflict. Additionally, the text does not assert\nanything about how researchers can or cannot resolve conflicting study results. Choice D is incorrect because the text does\nnot state that discrepancies between natural-habitat and lab-based animal behavior studies are due to both of the designs\nbeing flawed. Rather, the text states that the conflict in results can be the consequence of one or both of the studies having\nfailed to account for some factor.\u00a0\nAssessment\nSAT\nTest\nReading and Writing\nDomain\nInformation and\nIdeas\nSkill\nCentral Ideas and\nDetails\nDifficulty"
