        "Question": "The following text is from Edith Nesbit\u2019s 1902 novel Five Children and It. Five young siblings have just moved with their\nparents from London to a house in the countryside that they call the White House.\nIt was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite\nannoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork\non the roof and coping was like an architect\u2019s nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in\nsight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day\nby an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of Fairy Palace set down in an Earthly Paradise.\nWhich choice best states the main idea of the text?",
        "Options": {
            "A": "Although their parents believe the house has several drawbacks, the children are enchanted by it.",
            "B": "The children don\u2019t like the house nearly as much as their parents do.",
            "C": "Each member of the family admires a different characteristic of the house.",

        "Answer": "A",
        "Explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The text lists complaints about the house made by the mother and father, but then it says that\nthe children thought the house was a \"Fairy Palace\" and \"Earthly Paradise.\"\nChoice B is incorrect. The text states the opposite of this. It describes how the mother and father dislike the house and says\nthe children think the house seems like paradise. Choice C is incorrect. This isn\u2019t what the text says. Only the children are\nsaid to admire the house; mother and father both complain about the house. Choice D is incorrect. The text states the\nopposite of this. It tells us the house was ugly and poorly built (\"an architect\u2019s nightmare\") and suggests the children were\ntired of London."

        "Question": "To make her art more widely available, graphic artist Elizabeth Catlett turned to linocuts. In linocut printing, an artist carves\nan image into a sheet of linoleum to create a stamp that is used to mass-produce prints. In the linocut series The Black\nWoman (1946\u20131947), Catlett depicts the everyday experiences of Black women alongside the achievements of well-known\nBlack women. This pairing invites the viewer to draw connections among the women. The linocut process enabled Catlett\u2019s\nwork to reach a wide audience and supported her aim to unite Black women through her art.\nAccording to the text, what is significant about Catlett\u2019s use of linocut printing?",

The last sentence states that the linocut process \u201csupported her [Catlett\u2019s] aim to unite Black\nwomen through her art.\u201d\nChoice A is incorrect. The text briefly describes the linocut printing process but doesn\u2019t discuss the availability of the\nmaterials used in the process. Choice C is incorrect. The text says that the linocut process \u201cenabled Catlett\u2019s work to reach a\nwide audience,\u201d but that doesn\u2019t mean that linocuts made her \u201ccommercially successful.\u201d In other words, we don\u2019t know how\nmuch money she made off her linocuts\u2014we only know that more people were able to see her work.

        "Explanation": "Choice D is correct. The text describes how Alspaugh\u2019s scrapbook is both a record of her life and a historical record of\nnineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking.\nChoice A is incorrect. The text says that it was common for American women to keep scrapbooks of fabric pieces in the\nnineteenth century, and it says that Alspaugh was one of these women. However, it never says that other women were\ninspired by Alspaugh. Choice B is incorrect. This is too general and too strong. The text says that Alspaugh\u2019s scrapbook is a\nhistorical record of nineteenth-century textiles and dressmaking, but it never says that historians rely on such scrapbooks in\ngeneral to understand how fashions changed throughout that time period. This choice also fails to even mention Alspaugh,\nwho is the real focus of the text. Choice C is incorrect. The text does say this, but it\u2019s a detail\u2014not the main idea.

Use of the tool has led to several scientific and medical\nbreakthroughs over the last few decades, but the particles are often under prolonged exposure to the intense heat of the\nlight beams. To overcome the risk of overheating, and thereby damage, researchers sometimes attach nano-sized glass\nbeads to particles, allowing the light to focus on the beads instead of the particles.\nBased on the text, what is one advantage of attaching glass beads to particles when using optical tweezers?",

        },
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text\u2019s discussion of the\ndifferent counts of species in the Mediterranean Sea. The text states that Coll and colleagues reported almost double the\nnumber of species that Bianchi and Morri reported in their study ten years earlier. According to the text, this difference can\nonly be partly attributed to new invertebrate species being described in the years between the two studies, which means\nthere must be an additional factor that made Coll and colleagues\u2019 count so much higher than Bianchi and Morri\u2019s count. The\ntext goes on to explain that factor: researchers have a relatively poor understanding of microorganisms\u2019 morphological\nvariability, or the differences in microorganisms\u2019 structure and form. This poor understanding makes it hard to classify\nmicroorganisms by species and means that researchers\u2019 decisions about classifying microorganisms can have a large effect\non the overall species counts that researchers report. Additionally, the text says that the two censuses reported similar\nnumbers of vertebrate, plant, and algal species, which means that the difference in overall species did not come from\ndifferences in those categories. Given all this information, it most logically follows that Coll and colleagues may have treated\nsome of the differences among microorganisms as indicative of the microorganisms being different species, whereas\nBianchi and Morri treated those differences as variations within species, resulting in Coll and colleagues reporting many\nmore species than Bianchi and Morri did.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text explicitly addresses this issue by stating that the description of new invertebrate\nspecies in the years between the two studies can explain only part of the difference in the number of species reported by the\nstudies. The focus of the text is on explaining the difference between Coll and colleagues\u2019 count and Bianchi and Morri\u2019s\ncount that cannot be accounted for by the inclusion of invertebrate species that had not been described at the time of\nBianchi and Morri\u2019s study.\u00a0Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Bianchi and Morri may have been\nless sensitive to how much the form and structure of microorganisms vary within the same species than Coll and colleagues\nwere. If Bianchi and Morri had been less sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, Bianchi and\nMorri would likely have reported more species than Coll and colleagues did, since less sensitivity to within-species variation\nwould lead researchers to classify as different species microorganisms that more sensitive researchers would classify as\nvariations within the same species. The text indicates, however, that Bianchi and Morri reported far fewer species than Coll\nand colleagues did; since the text also excludes other explanations for this difference, it suggests that in fact Bianchi and\nMorri were more sensitive to within-species variation than Coll and colleagues were, leading Bianchi and Morri to report\nfewer overall species.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the text is focused on explaining why Coll and colleagues reported\nmany more species than Bianchi and Morri did, and an underestimate of the number of microorganism species by Coll and\ncolleagues would not explain that difference\u2014it would suggest, in fact, that the difference in the number of species should\nhave been even larger."

If we could get a different telescope to observe stuff inside our solar system 100% of the time and take more\nextensive images of certain things, then the HST could continue to be used mainly for observing stuff outside the solar\nsystem.\nChoice B is incorrect. This inference is too strong to be supported by the text. Even if the new telescope is deployed, the HST\nmight still be used as it\u2019s being used now. Based on the text, the new telescope would just be used for more extensive and\nlong-term imaging of solar system bodies, which doesn\u2019t necessarily overlap with the HST. Choice C is incorrect. This\ninference isn\u2019t supported. The text never mentions the possibility of modifying the HST, so there is no basis to make this\ninference.

Some art historians, noting that dairy products were a major component of the Dutch diet, interpret these\ndepictions as reflections of everyday Dutch eating habits. However, a group of researchers recently reviewed hundreds of\nfood-related paintings and found that lemons\u2014which could only be acquired in the Netherlands at great cost, since they had\nto be imported from warmer climates\u2014feature in Dutch paintings of the period more than three times as frequently as dairy\nproducts do, thereby casting doubt on the idea that ______\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?",

        },
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Choice C is the best answer. The text tells us that lemons\u2014an expensive imported product\u2014feature in Dutch paintings of the\nperiod more frequently than dairy products do. Since it\u2019s unlikely lemons were eaten more often than dairy, this fact casts\ndoubt on the theory that these paintings realistically depicted Dutch diets.\nChoice A is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests the opposite: it says that dairy products were a \"major component of the\nDutch diet,\" while lemons were an expensive import item, so we can infer that lemons were eaten much more rarely than\ndairy products. Choice B is incorrect. The passage doesn\u2019t mention painters from other countries, so there\u2019s no basis to\nmake this inference. Choice D is incorrect. In fact, the text suggests that Dutch painters do have reasons for depicting foods\nother than to show what Dutch people typically ate.

Soon, however, a\nsingular change began to be visible.

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201csingular\u201d most nearly means extraordinary. The text portrays an\nexperiment in which a character rehydrates a dried rose by infusing it with moisture. After prolonged contact with the liquid,\nthe rose begins to absorb it, undergoing an exceptional transformation: its color deepens, its previously \u201ccrushed and dried\u201d\npetals shift, and the entire flower revives \u201cfrom a deathlike slumber.\u201d In other words, an extraordinary change is visible in the\nflower.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201csingular\u201d can mean of or relating to an individual or to a single instance of\nsomething, this usage doesn\u2019t imply loneliness or an otherwise unsatisfactory condition of isolation. Moreover, the text\ndoesn\u2019t attribute such a condition to the rose. Choice B is incorrect. Although \u201csingular\u201d has several related meanings, none\nof them relate to being disagreeable or unpleasant. Moreover, the text doesn\u2019t portray the change undergone by the rose as\nnecessarily disagreeable. Choice C is incorrect because \u201csingular\u201d means extraordinary, not acceptable.

        },
        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. A person who is \"dogmatic\" believes strongly that their principles and opinions are true.\nBecause Du Bois and Locke are implied to have one \"unified vision\" of Black American identity that they prioritize over the\n\"diverse perspectives\" of different writers, they can be described as dogmatic.\nChoice A is incorrect. \"Proficient\" means \"skilled.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the text\nsuggests that Johnson was not skilled at making editorial decisions. Based on the text, the three editors just have different\nstyles; they\u2019re not necessarily more or less skilled. Choice C is incorrect. \"Ambiguous\" means \"unclear\" or \"open to multiple\ninterpretations.\" However, it\u2019s actually Johnson who encouraged multiple interpretations (\"diverse perspectives\"). Since Du\nBois and Locke are said to \"diverge\" from Johnson, we can assume that the views they published were not ambiguous, but\ninstead clear and firm (a \"unified vision\"). Choice D is incorrect. \"Unpretentious\" means \"not trying to impress others with\ngreater skill or importance than is actually possessed.\" Du Bois and Locke are contrasted with Johnson, but nothing in the\ntext suggests that Johnson is pretentious (trying to impress others)."

        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because as used in the text, \u201cspread\u201d most nearly means extended. The text states that the zoo\nis \u201chuge,\u201d that it covers \u201cnumberless acres,\u201d and that it is large enough that a train is needed to explore it. Thus, the text\u2019s\nemphasis on the zoo\u2019s size suggests that the zoo extended, or stretched, over a large area of land.\nChoice A is incorrect because if the zoo covers \u201cnumberless acres,\u201d then it could not reasonably be described as hidden, or\nconcealed from view. Choice B is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the zoo was discussed, or\ntalked about. Rather, the text focuses on the zoo\u2019s large size.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect. Although in some contexts \u201cspread\u201d can\nmean coated, it doesn\u2019t have that meaning in this context because to coat something means to apply a thin layer of a liquid\nsubstance, such as oil or paint, to a surface.

The text explains that\nMr. Brooke has a \u201ctoo rambling habit of mind,\u201d which the text likens to a disease, saying he is thought to have contracted it.\nTo contract a disease means to acquire or develop a disease.

The text claims that the discovery\nof similarities between the Tikal citadel and the architecture of Teotihuac\u00e1n, including a replica of a temple in Teotihuac\u00e1n,\nprovides evidence of outside influences on Tikal architecture. If the Tikal citadel was influenced by Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture,\nthen the Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture must predate the citadel, not the other way around. In this context, therefore, it wouldn\u2019t\nmake sense to say that the Tikal citadel shows precursors of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture.\u00a0Choice D is incorrect because the\ntext discusses how the citadel in Tikal indicates the influence of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture, which implies that the makers of\nthe Tikal citadel likely admired aspects of Teotihuac\u00e1n architecture enough to imitate it. Thus, there\u2019s no reason to think that\nthe Tikal citadel provides evidence of the Tikal people\u2019s \u201canimosities toward,\u201d or feelings of strong dislike or hostility toward,\nTeotihuac\u00e1n architecture.\u00a0\nAssessment\nSAT\nTest\nReading and Writing\nDomain\nCraft and Structure\nSkill\nWords in Context\nDifficulty"

Shakti is walking near a riverbank that she visited frequently during her childhood.\nShe crossed the woods she knew so well. The trees seemed to extend their branches like welcoming arms.

        },
        "Answer": "C",
        "Explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined sentence functions in the text as a\nwhole. The first sentence of the text states that Shakti knows the woods she is walking in well. The next sentence, which is\nunderlined, emphasizes Shakti\u2019s familiarity with, and sense of security within, the woods by describing how the tree branches\nare friendly and \u201cwelcoming,\u201d as they are depicted as extending open arms to her. The remainder of the text also shows that\nShakti is comfortable and content in the woods by describing her as \u201can old friend\u201d of the trees. Thus, the function of the\nunderlined portion is to emphasize Shakti\u2019s sense of belonging in the wooded landscape that she visits.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text and underlined portion suggest that Shakti is comfortable, not uncomfortable, in her\nsurroundings: the trees around her are described as welcoming and reassuring. Moreover, the underlined portion discusses\nShakti\u2019s feelings in the forest, not the river, since she hasn\u2019t reached the river yet. Choice B is incorrect because the text and\nunderlined portion emphasize Shakti\u2019s familiarity with the woods. The trees are inviting, and she feels like \u201can old friend\u201d to\nthe woods, so she isn\u2019t lost or confused there. Choice D is incorrect because the third sentence uses the phrase \u201cas an old\nfriend\u201d figuratively in reference to Shakti\u2019s sense of familiarity with the landscape, not in reference to her long-standing\nfriendships with other people, and the text and underlined portion never discuss her feelings about such friendships."

        "Explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text. The text notes that although\nsome studies have suggested that posture may have an effect on cognition, this phenomenon should not be overstated. In\nother words, the text begins by urging caution and restraint when discussing the effects of posture on cognition, implying\nthat even though some studies have shown posture to affect cognition, we should not assume that posture always affects\ncognition or does so in a strong way. The text goes on to discuss O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study as a \"case in point\" (that is, as\nan example of the point made previously). According to the text, O\u2019Brien and Ahmed hypothesized that since standing is\nmore cognitively demanding than sitting, standing subjects in their experiment would respond differently to decision-making\ntasks than sitting subjects would, which would show an effect of posture on cognition. What the researchers actually found,\nhowever, was that the standing and sitting subjects performed the same\u2014posture did not affect cognition. By presenting a\ncircumstance in which posture does not appear to affect cognition, the discussion of O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study shows why\nit is important not to overstate the phenomenon. The purpose of the text, therefore, is to discuss O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study\nto illustrate why caution is needed when making claims about posture\u2019s effects on cognition.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text discusses O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study as an example of why caution is needed when\ndiscussing posture\u2019s effects on cognition, not as an example of how research findings related to posture and cognition are\noften misunderstood. Although the text does warn against misunderstanding the scope of the relationship between posture\nand cognition that has been reported in some previous studies, O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s study is not one of those studies, and\nthere is no suggestion that anyone has misunderstood O\u2019Brien and Ahmed\u2019s findings.

But laws of physics at a microscopic or quantum level hold that those processes should be\nreversible.\n\u00a0 Text 2\nIn 2015, physicists Tiago Batalh\u00e3o et al. performed an experiment in which they confirmed the irreversibility of\nthermodynamic processes at a quantum level, producing entropy by applying a rapidly oscillating magnetic field to a system\nof carbon-13 atoms in liquid chloroform. But the experiment \u201cdoes not pinpoint\u00a0... what causes [irreversibility] at the\nmicroscopic level,\u201d coauthor Mauro Paternostro said.\nBased on the texts, what would the author of Text 1 most likely say about the experiment described in Text 2?",

        "Answer": "B",
        "Explanation": "Choice B is the best answer. Author 1 describes the puzzle that physicists still can\u2019t solve: at a microscopic level, the \u201claws of\nphysics\u201d suggest that we should be able to reverse processes that are not reversible at a macroscopic level (and, maybe,\nturn back time!). The experiment confirmed that those processes are not reversible even on the microscopic level, but it\ndidn\u2019t explain why. This supports Author 1\u2019s point that physicists still don\u2019t fully understand how things work at a microscopic\nlevel\u2014maybe the laws need to be revised.\nChoice A is incorrect. We can\u2019t infer that the author of Text 1 would respond this way to the experiment. Text 2 does name\ntwo of the physicists involved in the experiment, but it never suggests that they disagree on anything. Choice C is incorrect.\nThis is the opposite of what the experiment suggests. The experiment confirmed that the macroscopic-level law (\u201cthese\nthings can\u2019t be reversed\u2014like time\u201d) was still true on the microscopic level\u2014meaning it supports the current understanding of\nphysics at a macroscopic level.

        "Question": "Text 1\nToday the starchy root cassava is found in many dishes across West Africa, but its rise to popularity was slow. Portuguese\ntraders brought cassava from Brazil to the West African coast in the 1500s. But at this time, people living in the capitals\nfurther inland had little contact with coastal communities. Thus, cassava remained relatively unknown to most of the\nregion\u2019s inhabitants until the 1800s.\n\u00a0 Text 2\nCassava\u2019s slow adoption into the diet of West Africans is mainly due to the nature of the crop itself. If not cooked properly,\ncassava can be toxic. Knowledge of how to properly prepare cassava needed to spread before the food could grow in\npopularity. The arrival of formerly enslaved people from Brazil in the 1800s, who brought their knowledge of cassava and its\npreparation with them, thus directly fueled the spread of this crop.\nBased on the texts, the author of Text 1 and the author of Text 2 would most likely agree with which statement?",

Neither text suggests that the A. africanus fossils have been \"corrupted,\" but only that traditional dating\nmethods are difficult in Sterkfontein because of floods and soil mixing where the fossils were found. Nothing is implied to\nhave compromised the fossils themselves. Choice B is incorrect. This choice misreads Text 2.

        "Answer": "D",
        "Explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it reflects how the author of Text 1 would most likely respond to Text 2 based on the\ninformation provided.

It discusses how when a chiral\nmolecule is flipped, it results in something very different than when an achiral molecule is flipped.

The second sentence isn\u2019t an example of the first sentence\u2019s claim about achiral molecules: it\nactually introduces an entirely different idea that focuses on chiral molecules.

The phrase \u201cmaking\u2026at the time\u201d provides additional information about Cahokia that\u2019s not\nrequired for the sentence to make sense or function grammatically. As a nonessential supplement, this phrase should be\nseparated from the rest of the sentence with a comma.\nChoice A is incorrect. This choice results in a run-on sentence. The nonessential descriptive aside \u201cmaking\u2026at the time\u201d\nneeds to be separated from the rest of the sentence with a comma. Choice B is incorrect. This choice results in a sentence\nfragment. \u201cMaking\u2026at the time\u201d doesn\u2019t have a subject and can\u2019t stand on its own as a sentence. Thus, it can\u2019t be separated\nfrom the rest of the sentence with a period. Choice D is incorrect.

This choice results in a sentence fragment. \"Although\u2026asteroids\" is a dependent clause. It can\u2019t stand\non its own as a sentence, which means it can\u2019t end in a period.
